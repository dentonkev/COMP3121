## Algorithms
An algorithm is a **sequence of precisely defined steps** that can be executed mechanically.

**Sequential Algorithms**
- Comprised by a sequence of steps, which can only be **executed one at a time.**

**Deterministic Algorithms**
- Each step always gives the same result for the same input

## Efficiency 
Measure the efficiency of alogrithms using **asymptotic analysis**.
- O(n^2) for two nested loop running from 1 to n
